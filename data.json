We are building, India’s first socially distributed full stack fintech platform for middle class families in tier 2-4 cities. The financial needs of small-city India have been largely underserved since traditional players and even fintechs are unable to properly serve this segment\n\n* We have raised $25.75Mn equity  from top tier VC/PE funds.\n\n* WeRize is a full-stack provider, both manufacturing and distributing a wide portfolio of customized credit, insurance, and savings products for 300Mn individuals spread across the 4000+ Tier 2 to Tier 4 towns . \n\n* Families in small towns require high touch sales/after-sales service which can only be profitably provided using a social distribution model. The entire Indian fintech ecosystem is geared towards building DIY apps that help customers choose the right financial products for themselves. However, this approach doesn’t work for small-town families as they need high touch sales and after sales. Additionally, due to lower ticket-size/conversions vs tier-1 city millennial customers, digital CAC unit economics dont work, leading to fintechs staying away from this superb segment\n\n*Using the “Social Shopify of Finance” platform, WeRize has enabled thousands of financially literate freelancers in 1000+ cities to sell its financial products in their social circle. This solves trust issue as well as provides high-touch sales/after-sales .\n\n* Werize is the only Indian fintech platform/financial services player that has been able to distribute financial services through freelancers without any of its own feet-on-street/local branches. Our freelancers in 1000+ cities are managed only through Werize proprietary tech platform. This enables superb scalability and low CAC/ops cost\u003d\u003e highly profitable business model.","nb cse in":"1","subarea":"Bangalore Urban","nb employees":"156","added at":"2020-03-04","dynamics":"1","fundraising":"4250000","nb cse out":"0","entity":"Startup","longitude":"77,6244807"},"color":"rgb(0,161,242)","size":20.0},{"label":"Wripple","x":-210.43406677246094,"y":371.6080017089844,"id":"130061","attributes":{"area":"Georgia","country":"US","image":"logo/130061.jpeg","creation date":"2018-01-01","nb cse":"3","activity":"martech","color":"#00A1F2","latitude":"33,7717008","description":"[Automatic translation follows] The breakthrough platform that delivers real talent curated in real time.\n\nWripple’s breakthrough Agency Services Platform provides teams with the freedom to deliver top quality marketing and experience projects, while overcoming today’s constraints.\n \nThe platform’s marketplace connects brands with highly skilled, on-demand talent for greater speed, efficiency and flexibility.
