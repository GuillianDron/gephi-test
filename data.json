TOTEM provides a mobility solution \"for the last few miles\" and at \"staggered hours\", via a modular and cost-saving service of electric charging infrastructure for municipalities, commercial and industrial activity areas.\n\nEstablished in Marseille since April 2015, TOTEM mobi has a fleet of 200 vehicles and aims to deploy more than 600 vehicles as well as the progressive meshing of the main municipalities of the Aix-Marseille Metropolis by 2021. The arrival of new shareholders at the end May 2017 (Caisse de Dépôts et Consignations Group, PACA Investissement \u0026 BPMED) aims for a national development of TOTEM mobi in many cities to respond to the \"multimodal\" and eco-responsible mobility issues of companies and the general public.\n\nThe \"ecosystem\" of TOTEM mobi is based on a \"low cost\" rental offer to make short professional or personal urban journeys without CO2 emissions. The TOTEM fleet of vehicles is also a particularly remarkable, mobile and effective communication device in urban areas in environments where the possibilities of \"static\" advertising displays tend to be restricted.\n\nBrand communication, Low-cost vehicle rental, Urban media, Dynamic and responsible communication, CSR, Car-sharing, Transport, Mobility, Sustainable development, Urban billboards, Events, and Cross-channel media","nb cse in":"21","technology":"Batteries","subarea":"Bouches-du-Rhône","type":"Entity","url":"http://www.totem-mobi.fr","nb employees":"5","added at":"2018-09-27","colour":"#00A1F2","dynamics":"A","fundraising":"1513735","nb cse out":"34","entity":"Startup","longitude":"5,4170893"},"color":"rgb(76,112,169)","size":20.0},{"label":"BSMART","x":726.8760375976562,"y":-125.59577178955078,"id":"492","attributes":{"area":"Île-de-France","image":"logo/85603.jpeg","country":"FR","creation date":"2020-01-01","nb cse":"225","siren":"882644677","activity":"transporttech","latitude":"48,87368","description":"[Automatic translation follows] The 100% economy chain\n\nThe 100% economy chain","nb cse in":"85","subarea":"Paris","type":"Entity","url":"https://www.bsmart.fr/","nb employees":"105","added at":"2020-07-08","colour":"#00A1F2","dynamics":"1","nb cse out":"181","entity":"Startup","longitude":"2,300011"},"color":"rgb(121,78,194)","size":20.0},{"label":"Golem.ai","x":-55.061134338378906,"y":340.34759521484375,"id":"266","attributes":{"area":"Île-de-France","image":"logo/17114.jpeg","country":"FR","creation date":"2016-01-01","nb cse":"60","siren":"821352317","activity":"IT Services","latitude":"48,8695987","description":"[Automatic translation follows] The best of technology to automatically process your customer relationship (emails, social media, documents)\n\nSelf-contained, no-learning natural language interpretation technology.\n\nGolem.ai allows developers to produce interfaces using natural language.\nIt parses text formulated without a standard and performs functionalities in a program or in a\ndigital context made up of several elements (software, connected objects, services).\n\nFOR PROGRAMMERS\n - Quick integration into software\n - No knowledge necessary\nlinguistics or artificial intelligence\n - Designed to fit easily into\nan existing code and evolve with the\nsoftware\n\nFOR USERS\n - Freedom of sentence formulation\n - Instant processing of requests\n - Multi-languages\n\nNatural Language Processing and User Interfaces and Experiences","nb cse in":"25","technology":"A.I. - Natural Language Processing","subarea":"Paris","type":"Entity","url":"https://golem.ai/fr/","nb employees":"47","added at":"2019-01-06","colour":"#00A1F2","dynamics":"A","fundraising":"7089574","nb cse out":"44","entity":"Startup","longitude":"2,3476885"},"color":"rgb(76,112,169)","size":20.0},{"label":"Invest in Finland","x":-84.04637908935547,"y":471.03131103515625,"id":"304","attributes":{"image":"logo/21137.png","country":"FI","creation date":"2018-01-01","nb cse":"68","latitude":"60,1654493","nb cse in":"21","type":"Entity","url":"https://www.businessfinland.fi/","nb employees":"2","added at":"2019-03-26","colour":"#666666","fundraising":"0","nb cse out":"53","entity":"Incubators \u0026 VCs","longitude":"24,9131049"},"color":"rgb(147,71,71)","size":20.0},{"label":"Axians Portugal","x":-194.62806701660156,"y":385.8094482421875,"id":"378","attributes":{"image":"logo/44006.jpeg","country":"PT","creation date":"2017-01-01","nb cse":"1","activity":"IT Services","latitude":"38,7693595","description":"[Automatic translation follows] The best of ICT with a human touch.\n\nThe best of ICT with a human touch\n\nThe world is more connected than ever and the pace of change is staggering.\nWe deliver the perfect combination of technology and services to our customers, so they can meet the challenges of their own customers and their business.

There it will be connected to the Lee Tunnel, which will transfer the sewage to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works.\n\nOverflows of untreated sewage into the River Thames add up to tens of millions of tonnes every year.\n\nLondon\u0027s sewerage system relies on an integrated network of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). At the time it was built, the CSOs would release flows through discharge points along the river during heavy storms. Originally, this would happen once or twice a year, it now happens on a weekly basis and no longer requires a storm to trigger overflows.\n\nBy intercepting the sewage before it enters the river, the Thames Tideway Tunnel will help prevent the River Thames from being polluted with untreated sewage which can stay in the river for up to three months before the ebb and flow of the tide finally takes it out to sea.\n\nFor more information, visit our website www.tideway.london\n\nTideway Inclusive Recruitment statement:\n\nWe are one of The Times Top 50 Employers for Women, a Stonewall Diversity Champion, a proud signatory of the ‘Ban the Box’ campaign, and Disability Confident Committed Employer.\n\nWe pride ourselves on providing employment for disabled employees, providing support and adjustments during the recruitment process, and wherever needed in the working environment.

As for agroforestry, it stands at the crossroads between forest conservation and agricultural development and participates in the foundation of a circular economy.\"​ - Tristan Lecomte, Founder of PUR Projet.\n\nAgroforestry, Insetting, Reforestation, Sustainable supply chain, climate action, Nature Based Solutions, Waste Management, Farmers, and Carbon","nb cse in":"16","subarea":"Paris","type":"Entity","url":"https://www.purprojet.com/","nb employees":"154","added at":"2020-04-07","colour":"#00A1F2","dynamics":"1","nb cse out":"34","entity":"Startup","longitude":"2,3712138"},"color":"rgb(76,112,169)","size":20.0},{"label":"Venari Security","x":412.78631591796875,"y":43.00516891479492,"id":"205","attributes":{"area":"England","image":"logo/10715.jpeg","country":"GB","creation date":"2016-01-01","nb cse":"5","activity":"IT Services","latitude":"51,5072178","description":"Encrypted Traffic Analysis | Tool Detection | Internal and Regulatory Compliance\n\nVenari Security is the only company in the world focused on encrypted traffic analysis without decryption.\n\nWe provide organisations with visibility and insight into their encrypted attack surface and how encryption is actively used across their enterprise.\n\nEnabling these organisations to define, measure, monitor and maintain strong encryption standards, highlighting and reporting on deviation.\n\nGiving them actionable insights and intelligence about their encrypted traffic.\n\nAdvanced Analytics, Machine Learning, Fraud Detection, Cyber Security, Threat intelligence, Threat Detection, Metadata, Artificial Intelligence, Encrypted Traffic Visibility, Encryption, Next Generation, Data Privacy, Compliancy, DDoS, SQL Injection, Man-in-the-Middle, Crypto Hacking, Phishing, Ransomware, and Encrypted Traffic Analysis","nb cse in":"4","technology":"Cybersecurity","subarea":"Greater London","type":"Entity","url":"https://venarisecurity.com/","nb employees":"48","added at":"2018-09-27","colour":"#00A1F2","dynamics":"A","fundraising":"0","nb cse out":"0","entity":"Startup","longitude":"-0,1275862"},"color":"rgb(76,112,169)","size":20.0},{"label":"Newcy","x":-308.81573486328125,"y":205.79896545410156,"id":"57","attributes":{"area":"Bretagne","image":"logo/1974.jpeg","country":"FR","creation date":"2016-01-01","nb cse":"37","siren":"820129138","activity":"cleantech","latitude":"48,111137","description":"[Automatic translation follows] The best turnkey alternative to disposable cups in companies. 🌍☕️ - #MadeInFrance #CSR #Impacts ✊\n\nHave you noticed how many disposable cups accumulate in your business after every coffee break?\n\nAt Newcy, we have developed a turnkey solution that allows you to replace your disposable cups with reusable cups directly in your vending machines, water fountains and cafeterias.\nAfter use, you can put your cup in one of our collectors provided for this purpose and we will then take care of collecting it, washing it in our washing stations located in adapted companies and putting it back, all clean, in your distributor.\n\nSimple and effective, our solution allows you to:\n\n- to permanently remove your disposable cups and therefore the associated waste.\n\n- reduce your carbon emissions.\n\n- create jobs for people with disabilities\n\n- to strengthen your internal and external communication thanks to our customization options for your cups and collectors as well as our community activities to change behavior.\n\nReady to participate in the change?

A Baromate is a shelf that brings together one or more aquariums and one or more vegetable gardens in symbiosis, which feed each other. In the aquariums live fish, in the vegetable gardens grow herbs, aromatics, organic fruits and vegetables.\n\nLet grow... Harvest... Savor!\n\nAURA\u0027s Baromates work on the principle of aquaponics. The droppings produced by the fish nourish the plants, which are constantly fed by the water in the aquariums. Each Baromate is an ecosystem that grows stronger over time: the more time passes, the better the plants grow.\n\nWhat is the interest of the Baromates for your offices? You may not know it, but 95% of human beings are biophilic. In practice, it is a concept that defines why we feel so much better surrounded by living beings.

These relations are leveraged by our proprietary algorithms that allow us to properly detect, discover, quantify, and profile relevant communities, as well as to understand emotional and rational opinions, influence dynamics, and inter-community links. Moreover, we combine this advanced technology with high-level consulting to deliver the most relevant insights, strategic recommendations, and activation data. Bloom has been working for corporate executive committees, public institutions, and media, who use Bloom to: - Refine positioning by discovering which aspects of the brand and its offers create the most value for its clients and prospects - Discover communication opportunities by identifying the most relevant communities - Enrich community understanding by learning about its centers of interest, attitudes, as well as emotional and rational opinions - Boost communication effectiveness by identifying the optimal audience-content synergy - Co-design products and services by illuminating their use, perception, and market trends - Construct reputation strategy by identifying the brand image strengths and weaknesses, friendly and threatening influence networks, as well as effective argumentation.\n\nsocial media analytics, data analyse, social media, ia, intelligence artificielle, and smart data","nb cse in":"7","subarea":"Hauts-de-Seine","type":"Entity","url":"https://bloomsocialanalytics.com/fr/","nb employees":"53","added at":"2021-07-22","colour":"#00A1F2","dynamics":"1","fundraising":"12759674","nb cse out":"60","entity":"Startup","longitude":"2,2721151"},"color":"rgb(76,112,169)","size":20.0},{"label":"Qowisio","x":-359.5457763671875,"y":-435.0536804199219,"id":"109","attributes":{"area":"Pays de la Loire","image":"logo/7190.jpeg","country":"FR","creation date":"2009-01-01","nb cse":"15","siren":"513098376","activity":"telecommunications","latitude":"47,4947357","description":"Le spécialiste des solutions connectées clé en main \n\nQowisio is a next generation Internet of Things solutions maker.\nQowisio provides businesses with in-house designed turnkey solutions (Devices + network infrastructure + dashboards).

However, sepsis kills 48,000 people in the UK every year, which is more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer deaths combined. If it isn’t treated immediately as a medical emergency, it can take someone’s life in under 24 hours.\n\nSepsis is the body’s over-reaction to an infection or injury, which causes the immune system to attack its own organs and tissues. It affects 245,000 people every year in the UK and is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide (11 million people). If not caught quickly enough, sepsis can result in organ failure, amputation and death. However, with early diagnosis it can be treated with intravenous antibiotics and fluids, and the outlook is often good for the majority of patients who seek urgent medical attention.\n\nSepsis is triggered by any infection or injury (no matter how minor either may seem), and can affect anyone, regardless of existing health conditions. Some of the most common causes of sepsis in both adults and children are from urinary tract infections, infected cuts or bites, a wound from trauma or recent surgery and chest infections.\n\nThe UK Sepsis Trust was founded in 2012 by NHS consultant, Dr Ron Daniels BEM. We work tirelessly to raise awareness of the life-threatening condition, instigate political change for better outcomes for sepsis patients, educate healthcare professionals, and provide vital support to people who have been affected by sepsis.
