The entire Indian fintech ecosystem is geared towards building DIY apps that help customers choose the right financial products for themselves.

Additionally, due to lower ticket-size/conversions vs tier-1 city millennial customers, digital CAC unit economics dont work, leading to fintechs staying away from this superb segment\n\n*Using the “Social Shopify of Finance” platform, WeRize has enabled thousands of financially literate freelancers in 1000+ cities to sell its financial products in their social circle.
