The entire Indian fintech ecosystem is geared towards building DIY apps that help customers choose the right financial products for themselves. However, this approach doesn’t work for small-town families as they need high touch sales and after sales. Additionally, due to lower ticket-size/conversions vs tier-1 city millennial customers, digital CAC unit economics dont work, leading to fintechs staying away from this superb segment\n\n*Using the “Social Shopify of Finance” platform, WeRize has enabled thousands of financially literate freelancers in 1000+ cities to sell its financial products in their social circle. This solves trust issue as well as provides high-touch sales/after-sales .\n\n* Werize is the only Indian fintech platform/financial services player that has been able to distribute financial services through freelancers without any of its own feet-on-street/local branches. Our freelancers in 1000+ cities are managed only through Werize proprietary tech platform.
